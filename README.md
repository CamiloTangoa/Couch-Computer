## Whats Couch Computer?

Couch Computer is a single-page application that provides information on the technical tools I use the most. Developed in React using Vite, its main goal is to show the "valid" syntax of different methods, functions, prototypes, and more. Leaving all the detailed explanations to the official documentations or awesome sites like W3Schools, MDN, GeeksforGeeks, Stack Overflow.

## Why Couch Computer?

Going back to the word "valid", this site isn't meant to show the details of a particular line of code, but rather to demonstrate all the possible ways to use the given syntax of a tool. For example, in JavaScript, creating a set is a way to remove duplicates from an array. This can be achieved by using the Set constructor, the spread operator, and the array itself.
